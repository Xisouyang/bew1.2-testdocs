# What is -InsertAPI?-

The plan is a web scraper that will grab text based on specific genres\
and categories under that genre. It will be used for a story idea generator\
app that I'm building to grab possible ideas that fit under things like:

- Characters
- Plot
- Conflict
- Setting

that will be based off genres such as:

- Adventure
- Horror
- Mystery

# Table of Contents
## Installation








<!-- 1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
- Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
- Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

      You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

      To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
      Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
      (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses -->
